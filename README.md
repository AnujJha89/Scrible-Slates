# Scrible-Slates
This is a project where i used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to mimic basic MS paints tools from pen to paint bucket . The basic layout or i should say the frame work is done using flex-box where i divided the page into two part .UpContainer and bottomContainer. inside UpContainer .Heading inside bottomContainer .LeftContainer: canvas for painting and small icon to perform serveral feature like pen, eraser, full background change for canvas , eraser , line , clear. .RigthContainer: Slider for opacity and brush size.

used js for making it intractive like when you increase size it will show a dot increase size at the edge of canvas where you last left the canvas

hovering icons were made using css and several other property do interact to find more.
